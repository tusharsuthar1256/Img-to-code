<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest"></script> "and use icons like using <i data-lucide='icon_name'></i> Tag and also use in Script Tag if any lucide-icon used in code else dont use that "lucide.createIcons()" is this - '<script>
  lucide.createIcons()
</script>'"
Code Structure:

Final Deliverable:
Fully functional code in a single HTML file.
All styles included in a <style> tag within the <head> section.
